2. CRITICAL INTEGRATION GAPS
-----------------------------

[HIGH] PocketFlow Agent Initialization
- Issue: No agents registered in PocketFlow system
- Root Cause: Agent registration logic failing in _initialize_core_agents()
- Impact: Agent orchestration completely non-functional
- Fix Required: Debug agent creation and registration

[HIGH] Model Validation Integration
- Issue: ModelValidator exists but not integrated with discovery
- Root Cause: scan_all_sources() doesn't call validation
- Impact: Discovered models not tested for actual usability
- Fix Required: Integrate validation into discovery pipeline

[MEDIUM] Vector Memory Background Tasks
- Issue: _start_background_tasks() called but method not defined
- Root Cause: Incomplete implementation in VectorMemory.__init__()
- Impact: No memory consolidation or optimization
- Fix Required: Implement background task management

[MEDIUM] Enhanced Brain Error Handling
- Issue: Incomplete error handling in process_request()
- Root Cause: Missing try-catch blocks around framework operations
- Impact: Potential crashes in production
- Fix Required: Add comprehensive error handling
